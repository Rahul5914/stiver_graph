Let’s tackle Leetcode 547. Number of Provinces exactly the way it could appear in Nutanix / Google / Visa / Tower Research Capital interviews — from phone screen → F2F coding → debugging → optimization → deep-dive round.
We’ll go through it step by step so you remember both the logic and the reusable DFS/BFS/Union-Find templates.

🧩 Problem: 547. Number of Provinces
Leetcode link: https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-provinces/

🎯 Problem Statement (Interviewer-style)
Interviewer:

You are given an n x n matrix isConnected where isConnected[i][j] = 1 means there is a direct connection between city i and city j.

A province is a group of directly or indirectly connected cities with no other external connections.

Return the total number of provinces.

Example
csharp
Copy code
Input:
isConnected = [
  [1,1,0],
  [1,1,0],
  [0,0,1]
]
Output: 2
Explanation:

City 0 and 1 are connected → 1 province

City 2 is isolated → another province

💭 Step 1: Clarify and Think Aloud
Candidate (you):

So, this is an undirected graph, since isConnected[i][j] == isConnected[j][i].

Each 1 represents an edge between two cities.

We need to count connected components.

🧠 Step 2: Approaches Discussion (as you’d do in interview)
Approach	Technique	Time	Space	Pros	Cons
1	DFS (Depth First Search)	O(N²)	O(N)	Easy, Recursive	Stack depth
2	BFS	O(N²)	O(N)	Iterative	Slightly more verbose
3	Union-Find (Disjoint Set)	O(N² * α(N))	O(N)	Scalable	Slightly harder to code

💬 F2F Round 1: DFS Approach (Recursive)
🔍 Intuition
We visit every city, and if it hasn’t been visited yet — it means it starts a new province.
We perform a DFS to mark all connected cities as visited.

🧩 Dry Run
For

csharp
Copy code
[1 1 0]
[1 1 0]
[0 0 1]
Start with city 0 → DFS visits {0,1} → province = 1

City 1 → already visited

City 2 → not visited → DFS visits {2} → province = 2
✅ Answer = 2

💻 C++ Code (DFS)
cpp
Copy code
class Solution {
public:
    void dfs(int node, vector<vector<int>>& isConnected, vector<int>& visited) {
        visited[node] = 1;
        for (int j = 0; j < isConnected.size(); j++) {
            // If city 'j' is connected and not yet visited
            if (isConnected[node][j] == 1 && !visited[j]) {
                dfs(j, isConnected, visited);
            }
        }
    }

    int findCircleNum(vector<vector<int>>& isConnected) {
        int n = isConnected.size();
        vector<int> visited(n, 0);
        int provinces = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (!visited[i]) {
                provinces++;
                dfs(i, isConnected, visited);
            }
        }
        return provinces;
    }
};
🧩 Complexity
Time: O(N²) — each pair (i,j) is checked once.

Space: O(N) for visited + recursion stack.

🧠 F2F Round 2: BFS Approach (Iterative)
💡 Idea
Use a queue instead of recursion — same logic.

💻 C++ Code (BFS)
cpp
Copy code
class Solution {
public:
    int findCircleNum(vector<vector<int>>& isConnected) {
        int n = isConnected.size();
        vector<int> visited(n, 0);
        int provinces = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (!visited[i]) {
                provinces++;
                queue<int> q;
                q.push(i);
                visited[i] = 1;

                while (!q.empty()) {
                    int node = q.front(); q.pop();
                    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                        if (isConnected[node][j] == 1 && !visited[j]) {
                            visited[j] = 1;
                            q.push(j);
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return provinces;
    }
};
🔍 Debugging Round (Nutanix-style)
Interviewer: "Suppose one of your test cases fails. Let’s debug."

Failing input:

lua
Copy code
[[1,0,0],
 [0,1,0],
 [0,0,1]]
Expected output: 3
If your code gives 1 → reason:
You likely initialized visited incorrectly or used a global visited array not reset properly.

✅ Always reinitialize visited inside function calls.

⚙️ F2F Round 3: Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union - DSU)
🧩 Intuition
Each city starts in its own province (parent = itself).
Whenever two cities are connected, union them.
At the end, count unique parents.

💻 C++ Code (Union-Find)
cpp
Copy code
class Solution {
public:
    int findParent(int node, vector<int>& parent) {
        if (parent[node] == node) return node;
        return parent[node] = findParent(parent[node], parent); // path compression
    }

    void unionSet(int u, int v, vector<int>& parent, vector<int>& rank) {
        int pu = findParent(u, parent);
        int pv = findParent(v, parent);

        if (pu == pv) return;

        if (rank[pu] < rank[pv]) parent[pu] = pv;
        else if (rank[pu] > rank[pv]) parent[pv] = pu;
        else {
            parent[pv] = pu;
            rank[pu]++;
        }
    }

    int findCircleNum(vector<vector<int>>& isConnected) {
        int n = isConnected.size();
        vector<int> parent(n), rank(n, 0);
        iota(parent.begin(), parent.end(), 0);

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
                if (isConnected[i][j] == 1) {
                    unionSet(i, j, parent, rank);
                }
            }
        }

        unordered_set<int> uniqueParents;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            uniqueParents.insert(findParent(i, parent));
        }

        return uniqueParents.size();
    }
};
🔍 Complexity
Time: O(N² * α(N)) (α = inverse Ackermann, ~constant)

Space: O(N)

🧩 Round 4: Edge Cases
Case	Input	Output	Reason
All connected	[[1,1],[1,1]]	1	Single province
All isolated	[[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,1]]	3	No connections
Large N	200×200 all 1	1	Single big province

🧩 Round 5: Optimization / Follow-Up
Interviewer:

Can we use adjacency list instead of adjacency matrix?

✅ Yes — if input was given as list, time would reduce to O(V + E) for DFS/BFS.

🧠 Final Interviewer Notes (Pattern Recognition)
Pattern	Where Used
Counting connected components	Number of Islands, Connected Components in Graph
DFS template	Used in graphs, grids, trees
Union-Find	Used in Kruskal’s MST, Redundant Connection, Accounts Merge
BFS queue traversal	Used in 0–1 Matrix, Word Ladder

🧩 🚀 Trick to Remember
“Whenever you are asked to count isolated groups / regions / networks → Think Connected Components → DFS / BFS / Union-Find.”

Mnemonic:

"Group → Graph → Components → Count."

✅ Summary for Revision Sheet
Approach	Time	Space	Template Keyword
DFS	O(N²)	O(N)	dfs(i) mark connected
BFS	O(N²)	O(N)	queue + visited
Union-Find	O(N² * α(N))	O(N)	findParent + unionSet
